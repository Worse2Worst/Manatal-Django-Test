# Manatal Test

### Django Part:

##### Disclaimer:     
I didn't have postgresql on my machine, and I never used it before. 
So I have to install it.     
Also, it's been a while since I've done backend and Django jobs. So, I have to review a lot,       
and learn some new things I haven't done before. 



### Step 1: 
Time used: around 1.5 hours.

### Step 2: 
Time used: around 2.5 hours.      
I put comments in the codes about edge cases handling.     


### Step 3: 
Time used: around 1.5 hours.
